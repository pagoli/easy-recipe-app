# easy-recipe-app
This app was created for learning purposes only. It uses the Spoonacular-API, React (via Vite 2.9.9), Styled-Components, SplideJS, Framer-Motion and React-Router-Dom. I designed a simple background for the app in Figma. The fonts are hosted locally.

# Technologies used:

- Vite (2.9.9)
- React
- React-Router-Dom (Version 6)
- Styled-Components (with responsivity and variables)
- Framer-Motion
- SplideJS
- Spoonacular API
